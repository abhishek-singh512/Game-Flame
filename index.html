            <p style="font-size:19px;">Cricket is by far the most loved sport in India and constitutes part of the 
                country’s culture. It was first introduced during the British rule of India and has 
                then become tightly connected to the country’s history and tradition.</p>

            <p style="font-size:18px;">The India men's national cricket team, also known as Team India or the Men in Blue,
                represents India in men's international cricket. It is governed by the Board of Control 
                for Cricket in India (BCCI), and is a Full Member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) with Test, 
                One Day International (ODI) and Twenty20 International (T20I) status.</p>

            <p style="font-size:18px;">Cricket was introduced to India by British sailors in the 18th century, 
                and the first cricket club was established in 1792. India's national cricket team played 
                its first international match on 25 June 1932 in a Lord's Test, becoming the sixth team
                 to be granted Test cricket status. India had to wait until 1952, almost twenty years, 
                 for its first Test victory. In its first fifty years of international cricket, success was limited, 
                 with only 35 wins in 196 Tests. The team, however, gained strength in the 1970s with the emergence of players
                  like Sunil Gavaskar, Gundappa Viswanath, Kapil Dev, and the Indian spin quartet. </p>   

            <p style="font-size:18px;">They have also won the Asia Cup seven times, in 1984, 1988, 1990–91, 
                    1995, 2010, 2016 and 2018, whilst finishing runners-up thrice (1997, 2004, 2008). 
                    The team also won the 1985 World Championship of Cricket, defeating Pakistan in the final. 
                    Other achievements include winning the ICC Test Championship Mace five times and 
                    the ICC ODI Championship Shield once.</p>
            
            <p style="font-size:18px;">The country’s national cricket team had won some of the sports most important trophies, 
                        including the 1983 Cricket World Cup, the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, the 2011 Cricket World Cup, 
                        the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy. The team’s matches against Pakistan are some of the most-watched 
                        television broadcasts in India.</p>

            <p style="font-size:18px;">The Indian Premier League (IPL), a professional Twenty-20 cricket competition, 
                which was founded in 2008, is currently the most-attended cricket league in the world.

           <p style="font-size:19px;">Football (soccer) is another discipline introduced in India during the British colonial period. 
            However, whereas Indians have had some of the world’s best cricket players and teams, 
            they haven’t yet seen comparable success with their football efforts.</p>
            
            <p style="font-size:19px;">India has never participated in the World Cup, although it was invited to take part in 1950 
            where other Asian teams pulled out (the legend has it that Indians refused to participate because 
            they were not allowed to play barefoot) Despite the lack of great international successes, football remains one of the most followed sports disciplines in India. 
            It is highly popular both as a spectator and a participation sport.</p>

            <p style="font-size:19px;">Soccer or football is the second most favorite sport in India. However, 
                the Indian national football team does not have much achievement at the 
                global level, and the Indian national football team is on 96th rank in 
                FIFA rankings.Moreover, India organized the FIFA U-17 World Cup recently in the year 2017. Still, 
                football is the 2nd most-watched game by Indian sports followers.</p>

            <h3>The Indian Super League (ISL) and I-League :</h3>
            <p style="font-size:19px;">The Indian Super League (ISL) and I-League represent the top level of the competition in the country. 
                The ISL, which was founded in 2013, doesn’t employ promotion and relegation but is instead developing through expansion, 
                similar to the Major League Soccer in the USA.</p>

            <p style="font-size:19px;">The Indian Super League (ISL) is the men's professional top tier football league in Indian football league system. 
                It is organised by the All India Football Federation (AIFF), and their commercial partners Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL).
                For sponsorship ties with Hero MotoCorp, it is officially called as Hero Indian Super League.</p>

             <p style="font-size:19px;">The league currently comprises 11 clubs. Each season of the tournament generally runs from November to March. 
                During the league stage of the competition, each club plays against all the other clubs in a round-robin style. 
                At the end of the league stage, the team with the most points gets declared the Premiers and presented with a trophy named League 
                Winners Shield, along with the runners up to play in the play-offs, while the next best four clubs qualify to play qualifying playoffs 
                to join the top two in the playoffs. The season then culminates with the ISL Final to determine the Champions who are presented with the ISL Trophy.</p>

                Indian hockey shares a golden history with numerous medals bagged by the Indian hockey team at various international tournaments. 
                India is the most successful team ever in the Olympics, having won eight gold, one silver, and two bronze medals till date.
                 The country has the distinction of producing legendary players like Dhyan Chand, Udham Singh, and Dhanraj Pillay.</p>

            <p style="font-size:19px;">However, after the last gold medal at the 1980 Olympics, the team’s performances have declined through the last three decades. 
                Later in 2016, after 36 years of struggle, the Indian men’s team won a silver medal in Champions Trophy and reached the knockout

        <div class="container-content-large7"> 
            <p style="font-size:19px;">Kabaddi, is a contact sport, native to the Indian subcontinent.
                It is one of the most popular sports in India, played mainly among people in villages. 
                India has taken part in four Asian Games in kabaddi, and won gold in all of them. 
                Four forms of kabaddi played in India are Amar, Suranjeevi, huttuttoo, and Gaminee. Amar is generally played in Punjab, Haryana, 
                the United States, Canada, and other parts of the world, mostly by Punjabi sportsmen. 
                Suranjeevi is the most played form of kabaddi in India and the world.</p>

            <p style="font-size:19px;">This is the form used in international matches generally and played in Asian Games. Huttuttoo was played by men in Maharashtra.
                 In Gaminee style, seven players play on each side and a player put out has to remain out until all his team members are out.
                  The team that is successful in outing all the players of the opponent's side secures a point. The game continues until five or
                   seven such points are secured and has no fixed time duration.</p>

            <h1>History and development</h1>       
            <p style="font-size:19px;">Modern kabaddi is a synthesis of the game played in various forms under different names. 
                Kabaddi received international exposure during the 1936 Berlin Olympics. 
                The game was introduced in the Indian Olympic Games at Calcutta in 1938.</p>
            <p style="font-size:19px;">In 1950 the All India Kabaddi Federation came into existence and compiled standard rules.
                 The Amateur Kabaddi Federation of India (AKFI) was founded in 1973. After formation of the Amateur Kabaddi Federation of India,
                  the first men's nationals were held in Tamil Nadu (Madras) (renamed Chennai), 
                while the women's were in AKFI has given new shape to the rules.</p>
            
            <h1>Variation</h1>    
            <hr>
            <h3>Standard style</h3>
            <p style="font-size:19px;">In the international team version of kabaddi, two teams of seven members each occupy opposite halves of a 
                field of 10 by 13 metres (33 ft × 43 ft) in case of men and 8 by 12 metres (26 ft × 39 ft) in case of women.
                 Each has three supplementary players held in reserve. The game is played with 20-minute halves, with a 5-minute halftime break during which the teams exchange sides. </p>

            <P style="font-size:19px;">During each raid, a player from the attacking side—known as the "raider"—runs into the opposing team's side of the field and attempts to tag as many of the 
                seven defending players as possible. For a raid to be eligible for points, the raider must cross the baulk line in the defending team's territory, and return to their half of the 
                field without being tackled. Whilst doing so, the raider must also chant the word "kabaddi", confirming to referees that their raid is done on a single rhythm. A 30-second shot clock is also enforced on each raid.</P>  
                
            <h3>Circle style</h3>    
            <P style="font-size:19px;">Four major forms of kabaddi played in India which are recognised by the amateur federation. In Sanjeevani kabaddi, one player is revived against one player of the opposite team who is out – one out.
                 The game is played over 40 min with a 5 min break between halves. There are seven players on each side and the team that outs all the players on the opponent's side scores four extra points. In Gaminee style,
                  seven players play on either side and a player put out has to remain out until all his team members are out.</P>
            <P style="font-size:19px;">The team that is successful in ousting all the players of the opponent's side secures a point. The game continues until five or seven such points are secured and has no fixed time duration. 
                Amar style resembles the Sanjeevani form in the time frame rule. But, a player who is declared out doesn't leave the court, but instead stays inside, and the play goes along. For every player of the opposition touched “out”, a team earns a point.
                 Punjabi kabaddi is a variation that is played on a circular pitch of a radius of 22 metres (72 ft)</P>

            <h2><center>Volleyball in India</center></h2>
            <p style="font-size:19px;">India has a rich history with the game of volleyball. In fact, at the Asian Games,
                the country won three medals, and although things went south for a little while, things have finally started to look up.
                 While an Indian team has never participated at an Olympic Games level, the country has always regarded volleyball with great 
                 success at a regional level.</p>
           <p style="font-size:19px;">In fact, India ranked 5th in Asia and 27th in the world in 2013. 
               The sport has always done well in the youth and junior levels, coming in second in the 2003 World Youth Championships.
                This popularity also reflects on sports betting with many Indian players using betting bonuses to bet on their favourite teams and volleyball players.</p>

           <h2><center>The history of Indian volleyball</center></cebter></h2>     
           
           <p style="font-size:19px;">Although it was informally played for a long time, the first volleyball championships were held by the
                India Olympic Association in 29136. The sports gained popularity and structure along 
               the years with the formation of the Volleyball Federation of India in 1951.</p>

           <h2><center>India at the Asian Games</center></h2>    
           <p style="font-size:19px;">The Indian volleyball team had a great impact at the Asian Games, winning the 1955
                Asian Tournament in Tokyo and the 1958 Asian Games. The volleyball team, at the time, was led by the veteran Gurudev Singh. India also beat Hong Kong and 
               the Philippines but could not emerge as a winner against Iran and Japan</p>
           <p style="font-size:19px;">The 1962 Asian Games team was led by TP Padmanabhan Nair who also formed part of the 1958 team.
                This time, the team began with four straight wins against Burma, Cambodia, and Pakistan. 
                India found its match with its long-time rival Japan, making India settle for silver.</p>
           <p style="font-size:19px;">The Indian volleyball team finished fourth and fifth at the 1966 and 1974 Asian Games.
                The did not make it to the 1970 edition. They finished seventh 
               in the 1978 games and fourth at the 1982 Asian Games at home in New Delhi.</p>
           <p style="font-size:19px;">The Indian volleyball team started the Asian Games with four wins against Hong Kong, Bahrain,
                Saudi Arabia, and Indonesia. India lost against home team South Korea. However, 
               in between these wins, India finally managed to beat Japan, thanks to Jimmy George.</p>

           <h2><center>Women in volleyball</center></h2>    
           <p style="font-size:19px;">Women in volleyball were not given the attention that they deserve for centuries. 
               Not many women took up the sport full-time which led them to not being exposed to international tournaments and 
               never being able to participate in World Championships of the World Cup. However, the sport for women started to take
                shape in 1977-78 with veteran Dipti Malik.</p>
           <p style="font-size:19px;">In 1975, the Asian Women’s Volleyball Championship was formed which helped the Indian women volleyball team massively. 
               The team made their debut in the second edition in 1979, placing seventh and being able to qualify for its maiden Asian Games at home in New Delhi in 1982.</p>
           <p style="font-size:19px;">The women’s volleyball team dominated the 1984 games, winning four golds and a silver. 
               The team also won golds at the 2016 and the 2019 versions of the South Asian Games</p>

           <h2><center>Volleyball today</center></h2>    
           <p style="font-size:19px;">With the rise of Indian cricket, volleyball seems to have taken a step down in its popularity.
                The decline started happening with the death of Jimmy George in an accident in 1987. However, in the nineties, the Indian volleyball teams for both genders dominated the South Asian Federation Games, winning three medals each.
                However, the 2002 and 2006 Asian Games performances were not as remarkable.</p>
           <p style="font-size:19px;">However, things are finally starting to look up again. Although the Indian volleyball team did not qualify for the Tokyo 2020, there has been a renewed interest in the sport which is very pleasant to hear.</p>

            <h1><center>Tennis in India</center></h1>
            <p style="font-size:19px;">Tennis enjoys a considerable following in India, although it is limited to urban areas but still it is counted among 
                the most popular sports in India.[1] India has produced a number of tennis players, who have achieved international recognition and have made 
                their presence in some of the top tennis tournaments and grand slams.[2] All India Tennis Association (AITA) established in 1920, is the governing
                 body of tennis in India and is a member of the Asian Tennis Federation.[3] India Davis Cup team is the most successful team of Asia in Davis Cup,
                  who has finished as runners-up 3 times.</p>
            
            <h2><center>History</center></h2>
            <p style="font-size:19px;">Tennis has been a popular sport in India since around the 1880s when the British Army and Civilian Officers brought the game to India. 
                Soon after regular tournaments like the 'Punjab Lawn tennis Championship' at Lahore (Now in Pakistan) (1885); 'Bengal Lawn Tennis Championship' at Calcutta (now Kolkata) 
                (1887) and the 'All India Tennis Championships' at Allahabad (1910) were organised. In the history of major tournaments, India has already beaten among others France, Romania,
                 Holland, Belgium, Spain and Greece in Davis Cup ties (1921 to 1929)</p>
            
                 <p style="font-size:19px;">The history of tennis in India goes back a long way. In the 1880s, the British introduced the game of 
                tennis in India during the colonial rule and soon it started gaining momentum. BK Nehru in 1905 and Sardar Nihal Singh in 1908 were
                 later joined by M Saleem, Fayzee brothers and Jagat Mohan Lal who made it to last 16 stages at the Wimbledon. Ghaus Mohammad was the first
                  Indian to reach the quarterfinals at Wimbledon in 1939 where he lost to American champion Bobby Riggs.</p>
            
                  <p style="font-size:19px;">According to the All India Tennis Association, in Davis Cup ties between 1921 and 1929,
                 India beat, among others, France, Romania, Holland, Belgium, Spain and Greece. Top Indian players like Saleem,
                  Fayzee brothers, Cotah Ramaswamy and Krishna Prasad beat a large number of ranked European players and teams to bring glory to the nation.</p>
            <p style="font-size:19px;">India's last grand slam win came in 2017 when Rohan Bopanna won the mixed doubles title at French Open. At the end of 2010s,
                 Prajnesh Gunneswaran was the only Indian men's singles player in the top 100.[9] In 2021 Ankita Raina became the 2nd woman from India to win a WTA 
                 title and enter into top 100 doubles rankings.</p>

            <h1><center>Grand Slam Finals</center></h1>     
            <p style="font-size:19px;">In 1997, India won their first Grand Slam title at the French open, in the Mixed Doubles. 
                Since then Indians have won Grand Slam titles in the Mixed Doubles, Men's Doubles, Women's Doubles besides Girls' Doubles events.
                 No Indian has so far won a Grand Slam Singles title in the Men's or Women's category.</p>

            <hr>
            <p style="font-size:19px;">Wrestling is a combat sports involving grappling-type techniques such as clinch fighting, throws and takedowns, 
                joint locks, pins and other grappling holds. Wrestling techniques have been incorporated into martial arts, combat sports and military systems.
                 The sport can either be genuinely competitive or sportive entertainment (see professional wrestling).</p>
            <p style="font-size:19px;">Wrestling comes in different forms such as freestyle, Greco-Roman, judo, sambo, folkstyle,
                 catch, submission, sumo, pehlwani, shuai jiao and others.
                 A wrestling bout is a physical competition, between two (sometimes more) competitors or sparring partners, who attempt to gain and maintain a superior position.</p>
            <p style="font-size:19px;">There are a wide range of styles with varying rules, with both traditional historic and modern styles. The term wrestling is attested in late Old English,
                 as wræstlunge (glossing palestram)</p>

            <h1><center>History of Wrestling</center></h1>     
            <hr>
            <p style="font-size:19px;">Wrestling represents one of the oldest forms of combat. The origins of wrestling go back 15,000 years through cave drawings.
                 Babylonian and Egyptian reliefs show wrestlers using most of the holds known in the present-day sport. Literary references to it occur as early 
                 as the Old Testament and the ancient Indian Vedas[specify]. In the Book of Genesis, the Patriarch Jacob is said to have wrestled with God or an angel.
                  The Iliad, in which Homer recounts the Trojan War of the 13th or 12th century BC, also contains mentions of wrestling.[4] Indian epics Ramayana and Mahabharata contain references to martial arts including wrestling.</p>
            <p style="font-size:19px;">In Ancient Greece wrestling occupied a prominent place in legend, literature and philosophy. Wrestling competition, brutal in many aspects, 
                served as the focal sport of the ancient Olympic Games. Ancient Romans borrowed heavily from Greek wrestling, but eliminated much of its brutality. Wrestling is referenced throughout 
                both Ancient Greek and Roman literature. Many philosophers and leaders practiced wrestling and/or referenced the sport frequently in their works, most notably Plato, Socrates, Aristotle, Xenophon, Epictetus, Seneca,
                 Plutarch and Marcus Aurelius. Dicaearchus wrote that Plato wrestled at the Isthmian games</p>
            <p style="font-size:19px;">Early British settlers in America brought a strong wrestling tradition with them.
                 The settlers also found wrestling to be popular among Native Americans.Amateur wrestling flourished throughout the early years of the 
                 North American colonies and served as a popular activity at country fairs, holiday celebrations, and in military exercises. The first organized 
                 national wrestling tournament took place in New York City in 1888. </p>

            <h2>Chess in India</h2>
            <p style="font-size:19px;">Chess has risen in popularity in India in the last few decades primarily 
                due to chess Grandmaster and former 5-time World Champion Viswanathan Anand.It is believed that
                 chess originated from Chaturanga of ancient India. The All India Chess Federation is the governing body for chess in India.</p>
             
            <h3>Chess</h3>
            <hr>
             <p style="font-size:19px;">Chess is a board game for two players. It is sometimes called Western chess or international chess to distinguish it from related games, 
                such as xiangqi (Chinese chess) and shogi (Japanese chess). The current form of the game emerged in Spain and the rest of Southern Europe during the second half of 
                the 15th century after evolving from chaturanga, a similar but much older game of Indian origin. Today, chess is one of the world's most popular games, played by millions of people worldwide</p> 
             
            <p style="font-size:19px;">Chess is an abstract strategy game and involves no hidden information. It is played on a chessboard with 64 squares arranged in an 
                eight-by-eight grid. At the start, each player controls sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. The player
                 who moves first controls white pieces, and the other controls black pieces. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king, whereby the king is under 
                 immediate attack (in "check") and there is no way for it to escape. There are also several ways a game can end in a draw.</p>
